# FIRE calculator
This calculator calculates the years to retirement based on the 4% rule (but still can be adjusted for any given SWR). 
It also provides some charting for visual information with an option to save the graphs and export the calculations as CSV file.

## How to set up:
Required python packages are PyQt5, install by using:

```pip install PyQt5```

A compiled version for Windows and MacOS will be added when the program reaches full functionality.
