# FIRE calculator
This calculator calculates the years to retirement based on the 4% rule (but still can be adjusted for any given SWR). 
It also provides some charting for visual information with an option to save the graphs and export the calculations as a CSV file. 

More information on this under: https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/

## How to set up:
Required python packages are PyQt5, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly. Install by using:


```pip install PyQt5 matplotlib seaborn plotly```

A compiled version for Windows and MacOS will be added when the program reaches full functionality.
